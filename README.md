# Urdu Name Entity Recognition (NER) Project  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of Urdu Name Entity Recognition (NER) models. NER is a crucial aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which involves identifying and classifying key information (entities) in text into predefined categories. In Urdu, this task presents unique challenges due to the script and linguistic structure.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement effective NER models for the Urdu language using various approaches and techniques. These include:

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used for processing sequences of data.
- **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks.
- **Word Embeddings:** Techniques for representing words in vector space, capturing semantic and syntactic meanings.
- **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT):** A transformer-based model known for its effectiveness in NLP tasks.

## Expanded Entity Types
In addition to the standard entities such as **person, organization, and location**, our project also expands the scope of Urdu NER to include entities like **designation, time, date, currency, number, month, and day**. This broader range of entities allows for a more detailed and nuanced understanding and processing of Urdu text.

## Dataset: HUT_Comsats_Atk
An integral part of this project was the creation of our own dataset, named **HUT_Comsats_Atk**. This dataset has been meticulously compiled to suit the specific needs of Urdu NER, including the expanded range of entity types, and serves as a benchmark for testing and evaluating our models.
